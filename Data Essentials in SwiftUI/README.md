## 1. Data Essentials in SwiftUI
### 1.1 Important Questions for Data Dependent Views
- What data does the view need?
- How will it use that data?
- Where does the data come from?
### 1.1 Using `ObservableObject`
- Manage lifecycle of data.
- Handle side-effects.
- Integrate with existing components.
- Allows you to create a data model that provides all the data needed by all views.
#### 1.1.1 Creating `ObservableObject` Dependencies
- `@ObservableObject`: property wrapper that holds a type comforming to OO.
    - tracks the OO as a dependency and doesn't own the instance.
    - Will change appropriately when the ObservableObject changes.
    ```
    struct BookView: View {
        @ObservedObject var currentlyReading: CurrentlyReading

        var body: some View {
            VStack {
                BookCard(
                    currentlyReading: currentlyReading)

                //â€¦

                ProgressDetailsList(
                    progress: currentlyReading.progress)
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- `@Binding` using `$`: In the following example, creating a binding to the OO using `$` allows the button to change the OO value and have it apply to all other OO dependencies.
    - Refer to CurrentlyReadingWithIsFinished.swift and BookViewWithToggle.swift
- `@StateObject`: SwiftUI keeps the data's lifecycle alive for the entire time the view is up. This allows you to own the OO but also not persist the tracking of the OO values when the view is not visible to the user to reduce the overhead.
    - Refer to CoverImageLoader.swift and BookCoverView.swift
- `@EnvironmentObject`: leveraged when you need to define an OO at a higher level but the views dependent on it are separate by a few levels. Instead of defining the dependencies on the OO for every view in-between, we can use the following wrapper to only specify the dependency on views that are actually dependent on the OO.
### 2. Extending the Lifetime of Scenes
- State, StateObject only store view states while the view is running and is cleared when the app crashes or closes completely.
- SceneStorage: scene-scoped, SwiftUI managed, view-only, and can extend the lifetime and restor a view's state.
    - Refer to ReadingListViewerWithSceneStorage.swift
- AppStorage: app-scoped, user default, usable everywhere.
    - Refer to BookClubSettings.swift
